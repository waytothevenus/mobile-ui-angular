Also although statuses are sort of global variables `SharedState` will take care of disposing them when no scopes are requiring them anymore.\n\nA set of `ui-*` directives are available to interact with `SharedState` module and will hopefully let you spare your controllers and your time for something that is more meaningful than this:\n\n``` js\n$scope.activeTab = 1;\n\n$scope.setActiveTab = function(n) {\n  $scope.activeTab = n;\n};\n```",
